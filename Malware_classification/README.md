'malware_detection.ipynb' and
'malware_detection_second.ipynb'

are two Google Colab notebooks which contain a Machine Learning solution to Malware classification problem,
using 2 different datasets.
Each dataset has a number of features and one of them is the classification result,
'malware'/'benign' or 'malware'/'legitimate'.
The purpose of the projects is to predict with as high accuracy as possible if a data instance is a malware or not.
The two solutions have similar approach, but with some differences.
These are the data preprocessing, selection of feautures and the training/test sets split.
A Random Forest classifier was selected in both solutions, since after literature review achieves the best result
in terms of accuracy.
The accuracy achieved for these datasets and ML solution is 99%.
