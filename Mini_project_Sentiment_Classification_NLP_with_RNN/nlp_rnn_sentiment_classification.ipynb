wait until i checked out later today . counting on solitude and quiet , i d brought work to do , but it s now utterly impossible to concentrate . i stayed here once before and loved it , but this lack

the place is beautiful , the best part is the outside patio . the only two negative things are the small bar area happy hour is only in the bar and the birds . the birds are cute , very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips . n nthe food was great , i got the enchiladas which were tasty and i asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that . a friend got the tuna salad which she enjoyed . i am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good . the chips that come to your table are okay , i m not a fan of the sweet potato chips , the texture and taste just do not work for me . so when i go i ask if i can just get corn tortilla chips , and they are happy to do that too . the salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good , but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good . . maybe better n nthe best part of this place is the happy hour . the drinks are cheap and tasty . the best is the grand canyon margarita which a mixture of orange , cranberry and prickly pear juices , its strong and only bucks . the regular margaritas are excellent , on mondays that have a dollar pitcher deal , a friend and i were able to get three each out of the pitcher . good thing she lives in walking distance to the place . n nanother good thing about the happy hour is the food . the bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu . the best thing on that list is the chicken nachos , so good , best nachos i ve had in a long time . another is the cheese crisp with carnitas , very tasty . most of the items on this menu are around five dollars , and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two . n ni would highly recommend this place . \"\n        ],\n
