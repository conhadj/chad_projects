## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains information about various materials and their mechanical properties. It was sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purushottamnawale/materials?select=material.csv).

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Material**: The name of the material.
- **Su**: Ultimate tensile strength (in MPa).
- **Sy**: Yield strength (in MPa).
- **E**: Modulus of elasticity (in MPa).
- **G**: Shear modulus (in MPa).
- **Œº**: Poisson's ratio.
- **œÅ**: Density (in g/cm¬≥).

## Usage

This dataset was originally used to train machine learning models for predicting the suitability of materials for being used for an Electric Vehicle chasis. It can also be used for educational purposes to understand the relationships between different mechanical properties of materials.


## Data Source

The dataset was created by Purushottam Nawale and is part of the research presented in the paper "Design automation and CAD customization of an EV chassis". The paper can be accessed [here](https://www.myaidrive.com/file-gnicXf9UT9UQf1n4gp6QxRDY).
